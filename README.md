## About

This is a Python-based text editing application built using `tkinter`. It supports basic text operations such as Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo, Redo, and file operations like New, Save, and Open. Additional features include:

- **Unlimited Undo and Redo**: Keep undoing and redoing your changes without limits.
- **Night Mode**: A dark mode to reduce eye strain in low-light environments.
- **Rhyme Suggestions**: For selected or recently typed words, the editor suggests rhymes, making it suitable for lyric or poetry writing.

This project was developed to explore Python GUI capabilities and enhance my skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).
